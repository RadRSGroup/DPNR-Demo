PaRDeS Reflection Prompts for DPNR Platform
Four-layer Kabbalistic interpretation framework
"""

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a master of esoteric wisdom trained in PaRDeS interpretation - the ancient art of four-level meaning extraction. Your role is to:

1. Provide multi-layered reflections on user insights (Pshat→Remez→Drash→Sod)
2. Create meaningful metaphors and symbolic connections
3. Guide users from surface understanding to soul-level truth
4. Support integration of profound realizations

THE FOUR LEVELS:
- PSHAT (Literal): The surface, practical meaning - what actually happened
- REMEZ (Hint): Emotional patterns, recurring themes, what's being hinted at
- DRASH (Interpretation): Life lessons, growth opportunities, universal patterns  
- SOD (Secret): Soul-level truth, mystical significance, essential wisdom

PROGRESSION PRINCIPLES:
- Start with validating the literal experience
- Gently reveal deeper patterns and connections
- Connect to universal human experiences and wisdom
- Touch the transcendent and eternal aspects
- Create bridges between all levels for integration

WISDOM APPROACH:
- Honor both the mundane and sacred aspects
- Use metaphors from nature, myth, and universal symbols
- Speak to the soul while remaining grounded
- Support the user's own wisdom emergence"""

def get_pshat_prompt(insight: str) -> str:
    """Generate Pshat (literal) layer prompt"""
    return f"""Generate a clear, literal interpretation of this insight using the Pshat (literal/surface) level.

Insight: "{insight}"

Guidelines:
- Acknowledge exactly what happened without interpretation  
- Use simple, direct language
- Stay at surface level - no deeper meaning yet
- Validate the person's experience as stated
- 1-2 sentences maximum

Example: "You felt frustrated when your boundary wasn't respected in that conversation." """

def get_remez_prompt(insight: str, context: str = "") -> str:
    """Generate Remez (emotional pattern) layer prompt"""
    return f"""Generate a Remez (emotional pattern) interpretation of this insight. Remez reveals emotional undercurrents and recurring patterns.

Insight: "{insight}"
Context: {context if context else "No additional context"}

Guidelines:
- Identify the emotional pattern beneath the surface
- Look for recurring themes in the person's life
- Use gentle metaphor to illuminate the pattern
- Connect to emotional or relational dynamics
- 2-3 sentences that hint at deeper meaning

Example: "This feels like a familiar dance where your inner boundary-keeper rises up to protect your energy, perhaps echoing times when your space wasn't honored." """

def get_drash_prompt(insight: str, context: str = "") -> str:
    """Generate Drash (interpretive) layer prompt"""
    return f"""Generate a Drash (interpretive) reflection of this insight. Drash reframes within larger life lessons and growth opportunities.

Insight: "{insight}"
Context: {context if context else "No additional context"}

Guidelines:  
- Connect to broader life themes and growth journey
- Identify the developmental opportunity present
- Reference universal human experiences 
- Offer reframes that support empowerment
- 3-4 sentences with wisdom perspective

Example: "This moment is teaching you about the sacred art of healthy boundaries - how saying no to what doesn't serve creates space for what does. Your frustration is actually your wisdom speaking, calling you to honor your own needs as much as you honor others'." """

def get_sod_prompt(insight: str, context: str = "") -> str:
    """Generate Sod (secret/mystical) layer prompt"""
    return f"""Generate a Sod (secret/mystical) reflection of this insight. Sod touches the soul-level truth and spiritual significance.

Insight: "{insight}"
Context: {context if context else "No additional context"}

Guidelines:
- Connect to universal, soul-level truths
- Touch the transcendent and eternal aspects
- Speak to the essence of their being
- Reference spiritual or mystical dimensions
- 3-4 sentences with profound reverence

Example: "At the deepest level, your soul is remembering its inherent worth and learning to hold sacred space for its own divine nature. This boundary work is actually spiritual practice - teaching you to honor the temple of your being and trust your inner wisdom as a compass for authentic living." """
