## 📊 Detailed System Flow

### Phase 1: Input Reception and Validation

#### 1.1 Entry Points
The system accepts user input through three primary channels:

- **REST API** (`/assess`): Single assessment requests
- **Batch API** (`/assess/batch`): Multiple assessments (up to 10)
- **WebSocket**: Real-time interactive assessments

```python
# Example input structure
{
    "user_id": "user_123",
    "text": "I tend to be very organized and detail-oriented...",
    "assessment_types": ["enneagram", "big_five"],
    "context": {
        "source": "web_app",
        "session_id": "session_456"
    }
}
```

#### 1.2 Input Validation
- **Text length**: 10-5000 characters
- **Meaningful content**: Minimum 4 words
- **Language detection**: English text verification
- **Safety checks**: Content moderation for harmful content

### Phase 2: Clinical Linguistic Analysis

#### 2.1 NLP Pipeline Initialization
The system employs multiple state-of-the-art models for comprehensive text analysis:

```python
Clinical Models:
├── Sentiment Analysis: cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest
├── Emotion Detection: j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base
├── Clinical Assessment: mental-health/mental-roberta-base
├── Therapy Sentiment: j-hartmann/therapy-sentiment-roberta-base
└── Embeddings: text-embedding-3-large (OpenAI)
```

#### 2.2 Feature Extraction Process

**A. Basic Text Statistics**
- Word count, sentence count
- Average word/sentence length
- Lexical diversity (unique words / total words)

**B. Linguistic Complexity**
- Flesch Reading Ease score
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade level
- Complex word ratio (3+ syllables)
- Average syllables per word

**C. Syntactic Analysis**
- Part-of-speech distribution
- Dependency patterns
- Passive voice detection
- Subordinate clause ratio
- Noun-verb ratio

**D. Psycholinguistic Features (LIWC-style)**
```python
Categories analyzed:
├── Pronouns: I-words, we-words (self vs collective focus)
├── Emotions: anxiety, anger, sadness words
├── Cognitive: think, know, believe (cognitive processing)
├── Temporal: past, present, future markers
├── Certainty: always, never vs maybe, perhaps
├── Social: friend, family, colleague references
└── Achievement: success, goal, accomplish indicators
```

**E. Semantic Coherence**
- Sentence-to-sentence similarity
- Topic consistency across text
- Coherence variance measurement

**F. Clinical Risk Indicators**

    E->>E: Generate follow-ups
    E->>O: Complete assessment
    O->>U: Return results
```

### Phase 4: Framework-Specific Processing

#### 4.1 Enneagram Processing

**Step 1: Keyword Analysis**
- Search for type-specific keywords
- Calculate frequency ratios
- Weight by context relevance

**Step 2: Linguistic Pattern Matching**
- Modal verbs (Type 1: should, must)
- Focus patterns (Type 2: other-focused language)
- Achievement language (Type 3: success, win)
- Uniqueness markers (Type 4: different, special)

**Step 3: Behavioral Indicator Detection**
- Primary behaviors (core type expressions)
- Stress behaviors (disintegration patterns)
- Growth behaviors (integration patterns)

**Step 4: Clinical Correlation**
- Map linguistic features to type patterns
- Adjust scores based on clinical indicators
- Consider cultural and contextual factors

**Step 5: Confidence Calculation**
- Score distribution analysis
- Evidence strength assessment
- Cross-validation with other types

#### 4.2 Big Five Processing

**Step 1: Facet-Level Analysis**
Each trait is analyzed across 6 facets:

```
Openness
├── Imagination
├── Artistic Interests
├── Emotionality
├── Adventurousness
├── Intellect
└── Liberalism

Conscientiousness
├── Self-Efficacy
├── Orderliness
├── Dutifulness
├── Achievement-Striving
├── Self-Discipline
└── Cautiousness

[Similar for Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism]
```

**Step 2: Indicator Analysis**
- High indicator detection (keywords, patterns)
- Low indicator detection (opposite patterns)
- Linguistic marker verification

**Step 3: Clinical Marker Integration**
- Complexity metrics → Openness
- Modal verb usage → Conscientiousness
- Social language → Extraversion
- Other-focus ratio → Agreeableness
- Negative emotion → Neuroticism

**Step 4: Score Synthesis**
- Weighted combination of all methods
- Normalization to 0-1 scale
- Percentile calculation

### Phase 5: Cross-Framework Integration

#### 5.1 Pattern Recognition
The system identifies convergent and divergent findings:

**Convergent Patterns Example:**
- Enneagram Type 1 + High Conscientiousness
- Enneagram Type 7 + High Extraversion + High Openness
- Enneagram Type 4 + High Neuroticism + High Openness

**Divergent Patterns:**
- Flags unusual combinations for deeper analysis
- May indicate complex personality dynamics
- Triggers additional validation steps

#### 5.2 Clinical Synthesis
Integrates findings into coherent clinical picture:

1. **Personality Structure**: Core organization and dynamics
2. **Strengths**: Protective factors and resources
3. **Vulnerabilities**: Risk factors and challenges
4. **Behavioral Predictions**: Likely responses under stress/growth
5. **Clinical Priorities**: Areas needing attention

### Phase 6: Confidence Scoring and Validation

#### 6.1 Multi-Level Confidence Assessment

**Text Quality Factors:**
- Word count (optimal: 150-500 words)
- Semantic coherence (0-1 scale)
- Linguistic complexity appropriateness
- Clinical indicator clarity

**Assessment Quality Factors:**
- Score distribution (clear primary vs scattered)
- Evidence strength (keyword matches, patterns)
- Cross-framework consistency
- Clinical feature alignment

**Confidence Formula:**
```python
confidence = (
    text_quality_score * 0.3 +
    assessment_clarity * 0.4 +
    cross_framework_consistency * 0.2 +
    clinical_alignment * 0.1
) * confidence_multiplier
```

#### 6.2 Validation Checks
- Internal consistency verification
- Psychometric validity assessment
- Clinical appropriateness review
- Ethical consideration check

### Phase 7: Recursive Refinement System

#### 7.1 Trigger Conditions
Recursive assessment initiates when:
- Overall confidence < 0.75
- Specific framework confidence < 0.6
- High clinical risk with low clarity
- Significant cross-framework divergence

#### 7.2 Recursive Process

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Initial Assessment] --> B{Confidence Check}
    B -->|Low| C[Generate Follow-up Questions]
    C --> D[Collect Additional Input]
    D --> E[Enhanced Assessment]
    E --> F{Confidence Check}
    F -->|Still Low| G[Depth Check]
    G -->|< Max Depth| C
    G -->|Max Depth| H[Final Assessment]
    F -->|Acceptable| H
    B -->|High| H
```

**Follow-up Question Generation:**
- Targets specific low-confidence areas
- Uses therapeutic communication principles
- Personalized to identified patterns
- Maximum 3-5 questions per iteration

**Example Follow-up Questions:**
```
Type 1 (low confidence): "You mention valuing structure. When do you choose flexibility over rules?"
High Neuroticism (unclear source): "What strategies do you use when feeling overwhelmed?"
Low Agreeableness (needs clarification): "How do you handle situations where you disagree with others?"
```
