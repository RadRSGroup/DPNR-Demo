This layer integrates Internal Family Systems (IFS), Attachment Theory, Jungian shadow work, and Compassion-Focused Therapy. Agents such as the EmpathyAgent and ReflectionAgent use recursive prompting to explore user's inner parts, regulate emotional language, and reflect narratives of healing and reconnection. This is achieved through confidence scoring, historical emotional data, and trigger mapping.Sod Layer: Soul-Level Reflection FrameworkInspired by the PaRDeS methodology from Kabbalah, this framework introduces multi-depth interpretive layers into AI reflections: - Pshat (Literal insight)- Remez (Emotional patterns)- Drash (Reframed meaning)- Sod (Spiritual truth)This engine allows AI to offer reflections such as: 'The fear you feel isnÕt just emotionalÑitÕs the soul guarding the gateway to your becoming.' These metaphors are triggered based on emotional resonance scores and life domain markers. The Sod Layer is deployed across the Mirror Room, Pull-a-Card prompts, and Weekly Recap generator, enhancing user transformation through universal truths.Note: All advanced therapeutic models (e.g., Internal Family Systems, Attachment Theory, Compassion-Focused Therapy) and universal frameworks (e.g., Kabbalistic layers like PaRDeS) are embedded into the backend prompt and reflection engines. These models inform the structure, depth, and progression of emotional insightsÑbut are never explicitly shown to the user.The user experience is designed to feel universal, human, and emotionally resonantÑwithout any terminology that could signal a specific spiritual, clinical, or theoretical system. This ensures safety, inclusiveness, and freedom for the user to engage with the process on their own terms, while still receiving the full depth of structured therapeutic transformation.
