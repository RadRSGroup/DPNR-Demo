        1. **Clarify**: Define exactly what this insight means for your daily choices
        2. **Practice**: Create specific daily/weekly practices that embody the insight
        3. **Track**: Monitor how the insight shows up in your behavior and relationships
        4. **Adjust**: Refine your approach based on real-world results and feedback
        5. **Integrate**: Allow the insight to naturally become part of your identity
        
        **Timeline**: Start with 21-day foundation period, then ongoing refinement
